# Bikesharing Analysis

##Overview
To understand whether or not a bike sharing program should be adopted in Des Moines, we decided to take a look at the NYC CitiBike ridership program to get an idea of when people ride, how long they ride for and if there are differences between ridership of subscribers/non-subscribers and weekly/hour of the day factors. The visuals of this analysis can be found in this Tableau workbook.



##Results

There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)
There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)
##Summary

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)
