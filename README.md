# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview
To understand whether or not a bike sharing program should be adopted in Des Moines, we decided to take a look at the NYC CitiBike ridership program to get an idea of when people ride, how long they ride for and if there are differences between ridership of subscribers/non-subscribers and weekly/hour of the day factors. The visuals of this analysis can be found in this Tableau workbook.

## Results
### Trip Duration
The most popular number of hours to ride are between 4 and 6 hours. Consider looking at pricing for non subscribers with rates below 4 hours, rates at 4-6 hours and rates greater than 6 hours.

## Gender Considerations
Overall, there are more men who use the CitiBike service than women. The reason for this is men tend to be suscribers to the service and it looks like it is popular for commuting.
